# Task Workflow

- Start each request with the Goal/Context/Constraints/Acceptance/Validation pattern.
- Reference files with workspace-relative paths and line numbers.
- Note when concurrency, locking, or domain invariants must remain unchanged.
- Request a short execution plan for multi-step changes before editing.
